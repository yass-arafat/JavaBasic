- all computer programming languages there is this thing called “the stack,” also known as the “call stack.”
            - Official Java/JVM “stack” definition
              "Each JVM thread has a private Java virtual machine stack, created at the same time as the thread. A JVM stack
              stores frames, also called “stack frames”. A JVM stack is analogous(comparable, parallel, similar) 
              to the stack of a conventional language such as C — it holds local variables and partial results, and plays
              a part in method invocation and return."

- “When a new thread is launched, the JVM creates a new stack for the thread. A Java stack stores a thread’s
    state in discrete frames. ***The JVM only performs two operations directly on Java stacks: it pushes and pops frames.”

- “When a thread invokes a Java method, the JVM creates and pushes a new frame onto the thread’s stack. 
This new frame then becomes the current frame. As the method executes, it uses the frame to store parameters,
local variables, intermediate computations, and other data.”

- “The method that is currently being executed by a thread is the thread’s current method. The stack frame for
the current method is the current frame. The class in which the current method is defined is called the current
class, and the current class’s constant pool is the current constant pool. As it executes a method, the JVM
keeps track of the current class and current constant pool. When the JVM encounters instructions that operate
on data stored in the stack frame, it performs those operations on the current frame.”
                    
                                            What is a “Stack Frame”?
- “The stack frame has three parts: local variables, operand stack, and frame data alias Constant pool reference.”
            
                                            Summary to this point
I can summarize what we’ve learned about stacks and stack frames like this:

- Each JVM thread has a private stack, created at the same time as the thread.
- A stack stores frames, also called “stack frames.”
- A stack frame is created every time a new method is called.

            We can also say this about what happens when a Java/Scala/JVM method is invoked:

- When a method is invoked, a new stack frame is created to contain information about that method.
- Stack frames can have different sizes, depending on the method’s parameters, local variables, and algorithm.
- As the method is executed, the code can only access the values in the current stack frame, 
which you can visualize as being the top-most stack frame.
