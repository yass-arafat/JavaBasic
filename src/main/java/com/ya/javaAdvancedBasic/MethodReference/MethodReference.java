     * Basic stuff :
     * You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods. Sometimes, however, a lambda expression does nothing 
     * but call an existing method. In those cases, it's often clearer to refer to the existing method by name. 
     * Method references enable you to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods 
     * that already have a name.
