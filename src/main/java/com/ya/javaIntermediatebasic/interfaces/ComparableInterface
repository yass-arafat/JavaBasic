- Java Comparable interface is used to order the objects of the user-defined class.
- contains only one method named compareTo(Object).


                                        compareTo(Object obj) method

                                      public int compareTo(Object obj): 
It is used to compare the current object with the specified object. It returns

    positive integer, if the current object is greater than the specified object.
    negative integer, if the current object is less than the specified object.
    zero, if the current object is equal to the specified object.


- Several other classes from Java API relies on this interface for their behavior, for example Arrays.sort(), Collections.sort()
  uses this method to sort objects contained in Array and Collection in their natural order. Similarly SortedSet and SortedMap
  implementation e.g. TreeSet and TreeMap also uses compareTo() method to keep their elements sorted.


                            public int compareTo(Student st){  
                                if(age==st.age)  
                                    return 0;  
                                else if(age>st.age)  
                                    return 1;  
                                else  
                                    return -1;  
                            } 

input:              ArrayList<Student> al=new ArrayList<Student>();  
                    al.add(new Student(101,"Vijay",23));  
                    al.add(new Student(106,"Ajay",27));  
                    al.add(new Student(105,"Jai",21));  
output:
                    105 Jai 21
                    101 Vijay 23
                    106 Ajay 27
