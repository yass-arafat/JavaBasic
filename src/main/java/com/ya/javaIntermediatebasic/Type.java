/**
 * 1. will give compilation error. java compiler thinks it's an int . we have to append 'l' or 'L' after the number
 * ans. long i1 = 1234567890123456789l/L;
 * 
 * 2. first two assignment will work. no compilation error
 * but the last one will give CE because the arithmetic expression on the right-hand side of the assignment operator 
 * evaluates to int by default. Compiler won't implicitly convert int to short. you have to do it explicitly
 * ans. s3 = (short)(s1 + s2);
 * 
 * 3. In Java, when you type a decimal number as 3.6, its interpreted as a double.
 * and again we have to explicit it to float
 * ans. float pi = (float)3.14;
 * 
 * 4. is okay. as short takes 2 byte as 2^16 = 6536
