Q. 1) Can Enum implement interface in Java?
A. - It is known as Extensible enum. Enum in Java can implement the interface and override any method like normal class Itâ€™s also worth noting that Enum
     in java implicitly implements both Serializable and Comparable interface. 
   - Check the 2nd ans. how to implement an interface through 
     enum https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709593/why-would-an-enum-implement-an-interface


Q. 2) Why would an Enum implement an Interface?
A. - Basically what we can do with enum is that we can use enum name like this (e.g - Day.SUNDAY, Day.MONDAY etc ) or
     we can use their key value when enum is declared in a key value pair like this (CUSTOMER("customer", 5), SUPER_USER("super", 12)
     and BY IMPLEMENTING an interface in enum we can do method operations too. If you see the above link you will see that
     here in enum class PLUS object is implemented it's interface according to it's own way, MINUS object is also implemented
     according to it's own way. This facility we can achieve through implementing an interface in ENUM

Q. 3) Can Enum extends class in Java?
A. - No, Enum can not extend class in Java. Since all Enum by default extend abstract base class java.lang.Enum,
     obviously they can not extend another class, because Java doesn't support multiple inheritance for classes.
     Because of extending java.lang.Enum class, all enum gets methods like ordinal(), values() or valueOf().
